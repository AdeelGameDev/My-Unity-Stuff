Unity Keystore Password Automation Guide
This guide explains how to automate setting Android keystore passwords in Unity using a C# script and a batch file (.bat).

1. Import the Script into Unity
Open your Unity project.
In the Assets folder, create a new folder named Editor (if it doesn't already exist).
Copy the KeystorePasswordSetter.cs file into the Editor folder.
Unity will automatically detect and compile the script.
2. Configure the Batch File (LaunchUnity.bat)
Steps to Use:
Open LaunchUnity.bat in a text editor.
Modify the Unity Editor path to match your installed Unity version.
Modify the Unity project path to match your project location.
Save the file and double-click it to launch Unity with the required settings.
3. How It Works Together
Import KeystorePasswordSetter.cs into Unity and place it inside the Editor folder.
Run LaunchUnity.bat, which:
Sets UNITY_KEYSTORE_PASS and UNITY_KEYALIAS_PASS as environment variables.
Launches Unity with the specified project.
Unity Executes KeystorePasswordSetter.cs, which:
Reads the environment variables.
Automatically applies the passwords to Unity’s Android Player Settings.
Keystore is Ready for Android Builds, allowing password automation without manual input.
4. Notes
✔ Ensure KeystorePasswordSetter.cs is inside an Editor folder in your Unity project.
✔ Update the Unity paths in the .bat file before running it.
✔ This setup helps automate password management without storing sensitive information in Unity.

Your Android keystore signing process is now automated and secure!
